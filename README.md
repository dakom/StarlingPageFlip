StarlingPageFlip
================

This is a fork of NeoGuo's pageflip, with a few new goals (work-in-progress):

**DEMO:**

Just open the html file in bin-release folder via your browser

Note that it's using use-network=false and expects therefore to open locally via file://, not via server

**REQUIREMENTS:**

1. Greensock (swc is here in lib folder)
2. Starling (swc is here in lib folder)
3. Starling-Graphics extension (source in src folder)

**TO-DO:**

~~1. No reliance on classic flash shapes, rather use starling shapes~~
~~2. No need to bundle whole book as TextureAtlas- just pass textures~~
3. Soft mode can pull from top or sides
4. English comments


_Will update here as it's worked on_
