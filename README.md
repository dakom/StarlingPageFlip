StarlingPageFlip
================

This is a fork of NeoGuo's pageflip, with a few new goals (work-in-progress):

TO-DO:

1) No reliance on classic flash shapes, rather use starling shapes

2) Images/Textures can be applied at runtime

3) No need to bundle whole book as TextureAtlas.

4) Soft mode can pull from top or sides

Will update here as it's worked on
