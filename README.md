StarlingPageFlip
================

This is a fork of NeoGuo's pageflip, with a few new goals (work-in-progress):

**DEMO:**

Just open the html file in bin-release folder via your browser

**REQUIREMENTS:**

Greensock (swc is here in lib folder)
Starling (swc is here in lib folder)
Starling-Graphics extension (source in src folder)

**TO-DO:**

~~1) No reliance on classic flash shapes, rather use starling shapes~~

2) Images/Textures can be applied at runtime

3) No need to bundle whole book as TextureAtlas.

4) Soft mode can pull from top or sides

5) English comments

Will update here as it's worked on
